			<h2> About the Film</h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>After a Hong Kong nuclear plant and the Mercantile Trade Exchange in Chicago are hacked by unknown perpetrators, a federal agent (Viola Davis) proposes that the FBI work with China to find the cyber-criminals. The leader of the Chinese team, Chen Dawai, insists that convicted hacker Nick Hathaway, (Chris Hemsworth) be released from prison to help with the investigation, more than likely because the reactor was cracked using code written by Dawai and Hathaway. As Nick and his comrades chase their quarry, it becomes evident that the hackers have a sinister motive for their actions. This opportunity will reunite Hathaway with an old friend but will also put him in the middle of a power game between the American and Chinese government as well as arch villain hacker whose identity he has to find if he wants to keep his freedom and his life.</h3>
